# LIFX-ESP32-PowerToggle
This sketch will toggle the power on a LIFX light using the API, the original code is from https://www.reddit.com/r/esp8266/comments/518wwk/using_an_esp8266_to_control_lifx_bulbs_what_do/ but has been been updated to work with the ESP32 and display the live power status of the light.
