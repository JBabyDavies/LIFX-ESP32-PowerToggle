# LIFX-ESP32-PowerToggle
This sketch will toggle the power on a LIFX light using the API, the original code is from https://www.reddit.com/r/esp8266/comments/518wwk/using_an_esp8266_to_control_lifx_bulbs_what_do/ but has been updated to work with the ESP32 and display the live power status of the light.


To use open the sketch in the Aurdino IDE and change it to your SSID an Password.
You will also need the device token from the LIFX api.

All the pins are defined at the top and can be changed to suit your board config.
